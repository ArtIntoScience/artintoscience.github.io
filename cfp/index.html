Operations Philosophical/Art Into Science For operations, our audience is seasoned defense practitioners. We invite you to share your unique experience, strategies, and insights. While we encourage fresh content, we value proven methods and use-cases. We are looking for talks that are actionable and can be implemented by our audience.
For the philosophical track, we invite you to share your thoughts, experiences, and propose new ideas for building our discipline. This track is unlike most other conferences in that there is a high degree of interaction expected among speakers and attendees.
