+++</p><p>We are thrilled to announce the return of the Art into Science conference (ACoD)! After an impactful previous season, we are back to continue our mission of pushing the art of security into a recognized professional discipline. The conference will be held in Washington D.C. from October 25 to 27, 2023.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve crafted ACoD with two key goals in mind:</p><ol><li><p>Push the Art to a Science: We aim to foster a space where security methodologies are shared systematically and consistently, turning our diverse collection of professionals into a unified professional discipline. We discuss, model, and advance security concepts to facilitate this evolution.</p></li><li><p>Glorify the Defense: While many conferences focus on attack strategies, ACoD chooses to spotlight the defenders. We welcome operational talks on defense, offering attendees actionable tools, techniques, and ideas to apply in their own environments.</p></li></ol><p>ACoD is a working conference, with tracks that explore various investigations, case studies, and defense tools on the operations side, while philosophically pushing the boundaries of security science on the other.</p><p>We also understand the value of connections formed during such events. Hence, we&rsquo;ve built opportunities for networking, group discussions, and collaborations into our agenda. Whether you&rsquo;re an introvert or an extrovert, you will find opportunities to connect with others and learn how we can help each other advance in our field.</p><p>The Call for Papers (CFP) opens on July 1 and closes on August 18, 2023. We strongly encourage, and look forward to submissions from professionals of all backgrounds. Please consider contributing your unique perspective and experiences to our community.</p><p>Information about ticketing will be available soon.</p><p>Not sure if Art into Science is for you?
