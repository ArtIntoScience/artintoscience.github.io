&lt;p>&lt;strong>2025 CFP Open until June 1!&lt;/strong> &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScccFNorOxAbi98HehMdQ28oN-YfpL3TkPhVSBrbx9Vwmvftw/viewform">Submit your talk!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ACoD is a working conference, with tracks that explore various investigations, case studies, and defense tools on the operations side, while philosophically pushing the boundaries of security science on the other. We’ve crafted ACoD with two key goals in mind:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Push the Art to a Science: We aim to foster a space where security methodologies are shared systematically and consistently, turning our diverse collection of professionals into a unified professional discipline. We discuss, model, and advance security concepts to facilitate this evolution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Glorify the Defense: While many conferences focus on attack strategies, ACoD chooses to spotlight the defenders. We welcome operational talks on defense, offering attendees actionable tools, techniques, and ideas to apply in their own environments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Not sure if Art into Science is for you? Take a peek at our &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aconferencefordefense-acod8650">Youtube channel&lt;/a> to view presentations from our previous conference.&lt;/p></description><content>&lt;p>&lt;strong>ACoD: A Conference on Defense 2025&lt;/strong> is &lt;strong>HAPPENING&lt;/strong>, on September 10-11, at the &lt;a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/jNwJgt44pLnw3dZa6">Appian HQ Conference Center in Virginia&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
